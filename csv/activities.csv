10200;DevNet (DEV);BRKDEV-1003;Shipped & Mantl - The Business Case for Using an Integrated Cloud Development Platform;Developers are driving the market for cloud consumption and leading each industry into the new era of software defined disruption. There are no longer questions about elastic and flexible agile development as the way to innovate and reduce time to market for businesses. However, current cloud solutions do not enable application development platforms natively or provide the ability to create applications that are cloud native with elastic services. In addition, businesses are moving to application development architectures leveraging microservices which are becoming more strategic to their business strategy. When making the decision to build and operate an application in a cloud platform, microservices became central to your application architecture and strategy. This presentation will describe Cisco Shipped, the cloud native approach that address current devops challenges, the data platform that is required to support the business analytics, and the build, deploy, and run, including application monitoring and advanced user plane network enhancements. The overall architecture of the combined contributions will be described with a business use case.;Breakout Session;Approved;Cloud;90 min;Software Development;Introductory;2016-07-13 13:30:00;Mariners B, Lower Level;-;Software Development;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;Cloud;Kenneth Owens;kenowens@cisco.com;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;Yes;Yes;DevNet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Targeted Attacks, which the media refers to as APTs, are threats that must be addressed by any organization requiring networked computers to do business. In this session we will go over the run book techniques used by these threat actors and then go over strategies for mitigating those attacks. In this session we will focus on the concepts and techniques that developers of network applications need to be aware of to mitigate these styles of attacks. We will explore using pxGrid and other tools to break these APT style attack playbooks. 

Backgrounder: We obtained knowledge of these run book techniques from trusted advisors, peers in the industry and from our own observations. Our own observations included information from our CSIRT, our security products in the field as well as our internal phishing awareness campaign. After studying these techniques we devised strategies to mitigate them. Those strategies were then tested and deployed throughout our ecosystem.

Developers are driving the market for cloud consumption and leading each industry into the new era of software defined disruption. There are no longer questions about whether elastic and flexible agile development are the way to innovate and reduce time to market for businesses. In addition, businesses are moving to application development architectures leveraging microservices, which are becoming increasingly important to their business strategy. When making the decision to build and operate an application on a physical or cloud platform, microservices are becoming central to architecture and strategy. This classroom will clearly define what a microservices infrastructure is and how it enables elastic, flexible, and portable application workload deployment. The Mantl platform will be introduced, with each component described and demonstrated. The user experience Shipped will be used to build, deploy and run an application.

10324;DevNet (DEV);DEVNET-1693;Introduction to Achieving Perf and Scale On Large Clouds;"Please Note: Seating for sessions in the DevNet Zone is available on a first come first seated basis.
One of the most daunting tasks of operating an OpenStack cloud is to assess the performance and scale of the data plane and storage plane under load.
To give you an idea, here are just a few examples of performance and scale requirements required for a performant cloud: Verify that 2 VMs located on different hosts and the same Neutron network can exchange packets close to a 10 Gbps line rate Verify that a rack of servers can support 100 HTTP servers servicing 100,000 concurrent HTTP connections and 10,000 HTTP requests per second with 99% of all requests serviced within 100 msec Find the latency distribution of IO operations performed by 100 VMs doing random reads on a Cinder (attached) volume at a rate of 200 IOPs each
Such assessments are usually only performed by experts as they require the installation of the right set of tools combined with the proper methodology to run and orchestrate these tools in the cloud under test, followed by the collection, aggregation and publication of the test results. Because these tasks are highly interactive and manual, it can take easily days of work to produce summarized results that are in turn difficult to repeat over time.
In this talk we will present 2 open sourced tools developed and used by Cisco to tune the performance and scale of the Cisco OpenStack NFV Infrastructure. These tools help get past the afore mentioned barriers to entry by providing a fool-proof and fully automated way to measure VM-level performance and scale metrics for data plane and storage plane.
VMTP - Provides automated measurement of the data plane performance using various Neutron topologies.
KloudBuster - Provides automated measurement at massive scale of the data plane using HTTP traffic and of the storage scale using real storage access from a large number of VMs.  This session takes place in the DevNet Zone.  ";DevNet;Approved;Cloud, Open Source;45 min;Automation, Virtualization, Software Development;Advanced;2016-07-11 12:00:00;DevNet Classroom 2;-;Cloud, Software Development;-;Cloud for Service Providers;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;Cloud, Networking;Alec Hothan;ahothan@cisco.com;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;-;Yes;Yes;DevNet;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Deploying containers is only part of the puzzle. When containers are deployed tenants wants to understand how they perform and relate to the overall platform. We extended cAdvisor to publish metrics in Openstack Monasca compatible format to reuse that backend. Having containers labelled per tenant and application allows us to filter the metrics in a way that provides application wide data instead of container specific. Since containers are short lived and/or may be moved, having an application view is way more valuable and effective for tenants.

In this session, as a real example for developing data applications, we will show how to use data analytics to address the Cloud service operation challenge on the service availability. We will focus using real-time data from Cisco collaboration service and Machine Learning to model and forecast the service behavior. After successfully building the service model based Apache Spark with its machine leaning library and Spark Streaming, our effort continues in optimizing the machine learning algorithms with KNN, Bayes, Sigmoid regression to achieve better performance. With sufficient effort, we believe that Machine Learning and Big Data Analytics will eventually enable operation intelligence for WebEx Cloud Services. We will end this session by a discussion on how to develop an application like this using tools which will become available on Cisco?s data developer platform.

The world of applications is changing rapidly in the enterprise; from the way applications are increasingly hosted in the cloud, the diverse nature of apps and to the way they are consumed by many devices. The need for organizations and network administrators is to focus on ""Fast IT"" - ""Innovation in the Enterprise"" is growing, which means having to spend less time on daily operations, maintenance and troubleshooting and more time on delivering business value with newer services. Cisco AVC with its NBAR2 technology is designed to detect applications and measure application performance through measuring round trip time, retransmission rates, jitter, delay, packet loss, MoS, URL statistics etc. Those details are transmitted using Flexible Netflow/IPFIX, so partners could leverage the data for application usage reporting, performance reporting and troubleshooting application issues to deliver best possible application experience.

11412;DevNet (DEV);DEVNET-2064;Applying Hyperscale Design Patterns to Routing;"Please Note: Seating for sessions in the DevNet Zone is available on a first come first seated basis.

Sun Microsystems' famous quote ""The network is the computer"" served for more than one decade as an inspiration how to design distributed web applications.
In this session we will revisit prevailing Hyper-scale application design patterns and show how those principles can be applied to build the next generation distributed routing and forwarding platform with unbounded scale.
Beside technical attributes (e.g. JSON, Open Network Linux, LXC Containers, PUBSUB) the most critical element is to establish an open, micro-service architecture, where entire modules may get sourced from multiple vendors.At the example of the fd.io VPP (=Cisco open-sourced packet forwarding core) we will share our experience of integrating components from different hardware and software vendors for building the next generation Hyper-scale Routing Platform.

In addition to the session a prototype implementation will be demo'ed at the VPP booth.

Who should attend: Data Center Operators and Internet Service Providers familiar with the BGP, IS-IS protocols and high-end routing platforms.
